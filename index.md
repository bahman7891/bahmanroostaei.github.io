## Selected Projects

### Scalable EV Detection for Smart Grid Control *(Patent-Pending)*
Led the development of a real-time electric vehicle (EV) detection system using high-resolution time series data from household energy meters. The project included edge-optimized machine learning models, real-time data ingestion, and backend integration with smart grid control systems. The solution has been submitted as part of a U.S. **patent application**. 

### Modular Forecasting Platform
Designed and deployed a cloud-native pipeline for forecasting event-driven outcomes in structured and temporal datasets. Implemented model versioning, auto-retraining, and CI/CD using GitHub Actions and MLflow.

### Signal Classification on Embedded Devices
Developed stacked ML and lightweight deep learning models for real-time signal classification on constrained hardware. Integrated with embedded runtimes and backend services for performance monitoring and automated reporting.
