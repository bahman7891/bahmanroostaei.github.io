## Selected Projects

### Scalable EV Detection for Smart Grid Control
Led the development of real-time electric vehicle (EV) charging detection system using high-resolution time series data from household energy meters. The project included edge-optimized machine learning models, real-time data ingestion, and backend integration with smart grid control systems. The solution has been submitted as part of a U.S. [**patent application**](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/18827336?application=). 

### Modular Forecasting Platform
Designed and deployed a cloud-native pipeline for forecasting event-driven outcomes in structured and temporal datasets. Implemented model versioning, auto-retraining, and CI/CD using Azure Pipeline and MLflow.

### Signal Classification on Embedded Devices
Developed stacked ML and lightweight deep learning models for real-time signal classification on constrained hardware. Integrated with embedded runtimes and backend services for performance monitoring and automated reporting.

### Fault Detection Algorithms for Metering Systems
As lead data scientist, I developed algorithms to identify faulty utility meters based on consumption patterns‚Äîcontributing a core component to the company‚Äôs flagship product, Revenue Locator. I designed SQL-based pipelines to extract high-signal features from raw metering data, created scalable feature databases, and supported the modeling layer with Python-based validation. The system enabled proactive fault detection across large meter networks and played a key role in operational diagnostics and revenue protection.
